# 📧 Email Setup - What Should You Use?

## Your Options

### Option 1: Create a YUGI Gmail Account ⭐ (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional (emails come from "YUGI" not personal)
- ✅ Separate from your personal email
- ✅ Can add multiple team members later
- ✅ Better branding

**How to do it:**
1. Go to: https://accounts.google.com/signup
2. Create: `yugi.app@gmail.com` (or similar)
3. Enable 2FA on the new account
4. Generate app password
5. Use in Railway

### Option 2: Use Your Personal Gmail (Easier for Now)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick and easy
- ✅ Already set up
- ✅ Works immediately

**Cons:**
- ❌ Emails sent from your personal email
- ❌ Mixed with personal stuff
- ❌ Looks unprofessional to users

---

## My Recommendation

**Start with your personal Gmail for testing:** ⚡
- Get Railway deployment working
- Make sure everything works
- Test the email functionality

**Then switch to YUGI email:** ⭐
- Once everything works
- Create a dedicated YUGI Gmail account
- Update Railway variables with new email
- Takes 5 minutes

## What I Suggest

**For now:** Use your personal Gmail
- Just to get things working
- Change it later (super easy!)

**Later:** Switch to YUGI email
- Before you go live with real users
- Takes 5 minutes to update

## How Easy is it to Change Later?

**Super easy!** Just:
1. Create new YUGI Gmail account
2. Go to Railway → Variables
3. Change `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`
4. Done! ✅

**Use whatever is fastest right now to get Railway working!**
You can always change it later - it takes 5 minutes! 😊
